#Install Cuda toolkit
1. check which cuda toolkit is supported with your pytorch version https://pytorch.org/
the current pytorch supports cuda toolkit 10.2 so I will need to install cuda 10.2


2. from nvidia website find your cuda toolkit version (may need to look for previous versions)
I got cuda toolkit 10.2 which is a previous release from https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exenetwork
